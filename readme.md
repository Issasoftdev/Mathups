This was another school project following the Travelza Website, whereby we had to create a Javascript game that had to meet specific requirements.

During this project I got to practice and learn:

- Selecting and Manipulating HTML Elements
- Reading & Updating HTML Elements
- CSS Classes & Variables
- Responsive Design
- Event Listeners and Handling Events
- Working with an Array in Javascript
- Object Oriented Programming
